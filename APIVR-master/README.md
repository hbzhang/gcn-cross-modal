### "Proposal-based Approach for Activity Image-to-Video Retrieval"

#### Preparation
We prepare activity proposal-based datasets by [R-C3D](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/R-C3D). Each video is represented by a bag of proposals.

To run the demo: 

    # Thumos14 dataset
    python train_adv_crossmodal_triplet_thumos.py # with triplet loss
