./circulant/*
    Circulant Binary Embedding
    This matlab based implementation is not optimized for speed

./example.m
    example on some small-scale toy data

./normalization.m
    always normalize the data before generating binary code
    l2 normalization should be the default method for most types of data

./getResult.m
./test_all_methods.m
    driver functions for all the binary code methods

./baselines
    Code for some baseline methods are included. 
    The baseline methods can also be downloaded at Yunchao Gong's homepage:
    http://www.unc.edu/~yunchao/

    All the terms from the original authors apply.
    Methods include LSH, BITQ, SITQ, SKLSH, ITQ

./misc_lib/*
    some utility functions
